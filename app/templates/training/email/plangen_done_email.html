<p>Dear {{ user.username }},</p>
<p>your {{ model }} plan was generated.</p>
<p>Starting at a modeled performance of {{ plan.ui_start_perf()|round(2) }} {{ plan.perf_metric }},<br>
your goal was {{ plan.ui_goal()|round(2) }} {{ plan.perf_metric }}.</p> 
<p>The plan leads you to {{ plan.ui_end_perf()|round(2) }} {{ plan.perf_metric }}.</p> 
<p>The approximation quality is {{ approx_quality|round(2) }}%.</p>

{% if not below_threshold %}
<p>There are a few things you can try to improve the approximation quality like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>lowering your performance goal</li>
	<li>increase the maximum load</li>
	<li>decrease the minimum load</li>
	<li>increase the plan length</li>
	<li>adjust the number of weekly training days</li>
	<li>adjust the number of off days and off weeks</li>
</ul>
{% endif %}

{% include "plan_note.html" %}

<p>Your plan loads in {{ plan.load_metric }}:</p>
  {% for entry in plan.to_calendar() %}
    {{ entry }} </br>
  {% endfor %}

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The traipor Team</p>
