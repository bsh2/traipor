Dear {{ user.username }},
your {{ model }} plan was generated.
Starting at a modeled performance of {{ plan.ui_start_perf()|round(2) }} {{ plan.perf_metric }},
your goal was {{ plan.ui_goal()|round(2) }} {{ plan.perf_metric }}.
The plan leads you to {{ plan.ui_end_perf()|round(2) }} {{ plan.perf_metric }}.
The approximation quality is {{ approx_quality|round(2) }}%.

{% if not below_threshold %}
There are a few things you can try to improve the approximation quality like:
  - lowering your performance goal
  - increase the maximum load
  - decrease the minimum load
  - increase the plan length
  - adjust the number of weekly training days
  - adjust the number of off days and off weeks
{% endif %}

{% include "plan_note.txt" %}

Your plan loads in {{ plan.load_metric }}:
  {% for entry in plan.to_calendar() %}
    {{ entry }}
  {% endfor %}

Sincerely,
The traipor Team
