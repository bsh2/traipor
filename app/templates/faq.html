    <h4>How is this service supposed to be used?</h4>
    In short:
    <ul>
      <li>Upload your <a href="http://www.goldencheetah.org/">GoldenCheetah</a> metrics export file.</li>
      <li>Start your Fitness Fatigue and your PerPot model fitting.</li>
      <li>Generate your Fitness Fatigue and your PerPot plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What's the purpose of this project?</h4>
    This project is part of a master thesis in computer science at the
    <a href="http://www.h-brs.de/en">Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences</a>.
    It's embedded in a larger research project called <a href="http://stella-mobility.weebly.com/index.html">STELLA</a>.
    The goal is to evaluate, if training models can be used with real world data
    not collected in a lab environment and if automatically generated plans
    based on these models can help cyclists to reach their goals.

  <div class=well>
    <h4>What is a training model?</h4>
    In our case a training model is a mathematical defined construct that tries
    to simulate how the human body responds to training loads. It takes some
    individual model parameters and a series of training loads as input and
    returns a series of performance numbers that should be close to the
    performance adaptation in reality.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>What is a parameter fitting?</h4>
    The process of parameter fitting tries to find the individual model
    parameters that let the model simulate reality as close as possible. The
    fitting can be done with a numerical technique like L-BFGS-B or other
    optimization techniques.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>Why do you need my GoldenCheetah metrics export?</h4>
    We use the performance and training load numbers for the individual
    parameter fitting.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>How can I create a GoldenCheetah metrics export file?</h4>
    To export your metrics from <a href="http://www.goldencheetah.org/">GoldenCheetah</a>, 
    go to the menu item "Export Metrics as CSV...". Depending on your version of
    GC, it may be located in the "Activity" or "Tools" menu and you may have to
    switch to the "Activities" view first.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>How do you generate the training plans?</h4>
    We use evolutionary techniques like CMA-ES or Differential Evolution. More
    information will be published in a paper in September as part of the <a href="http://inista.org">INISTA</a> 
    conference proceedings.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>Don't you think a training plan needs more than just a series of load numbers?</h4>
    We are aware of the short comings of the models and our approach. But we
    still think it's worth to evaluate these models with real world data as a
    good model can be helpful in the design of a personal training plan.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>The generated plan reaches my goal but the modeled performance changes
	    during the plan are pretty unrealistic. What's wrong?</h4>
    The models aren't perfect and are highly dependent on the individual
    parameters. So the model could be at fault or your parameters were fitted in
    a bad way. Like mentioned above, we are doing this to find such flaws.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>Where can I get more information about the used models?</h4>
    Read about Fitness Fatigue <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5409179&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5409179">here</a>.
    Read about PerPot <a href="http://www.americankinesiology.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/31.pdf">here</a>.
    Read a comparison of the two models <a href="http://www.sport.uni-bayreuth.de/spo_wiss_I/de/download/trainingsadaptation/IJCSS-Volume7_Edition2_Pfeiffer.pdf">here</a>.
    More papers can be found with the usual search engines.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>Why do my modeled start performances for a plan differ between the used models?</h4>
    The two used models differ a lot in their definition and the quality of the
    result of the parameter fitting process may also differ from model to model.
    So differences in the modeled performance values are to be expected.
  </div>

  <div class=well>
    <h4>I have some other question. What now?</h4>
    No problem. Just tell <a href="mailto:traipor@inf.h-brs.de">us</a>.
